                Based on comments figure out if task was already worked on 
                and if this time it is required to adjust something instead of creating issue to implement the story.
                If this is the case (issue was already worked on) this means that issue failed Test and we need to
                create new issues that addresses Test findings. 
                Understand that based on current issue comments and their time.
                If there are no comments or existing comments don't show that issue was already worked on, 
                then create new issues that are needed for this story issue.
                Summary: Break down the current Story issue into Task issues based on pre-planned ideas from comments, 
                ensuring detailed descriptions for each task. QA existing comments to clarify requirements, 
                check if the task was previously worked on, and determine if adjustments are needed. 
                If adjustments are needed then it means that the task failed Test, 
                create new issues to address Test findings. If thereâ€™s no evidence of prior work, 
                create new tasks to implement the Story. 
                Use comment timestamps and context to guide decisions, 
                ensuring alignment with Test requirements.
                Now using what you know, analyze current_issue and comments carefully.
                Suggest how to split current Story issue into smaller scope Task issues (make sure to stick with Task issue scope and create as many Task issues as necessary).
                Dont forget to mention scope of the Task issues you create.
                Make sure each Task issue is small enough to be implemented in a single code file or even better - one part of a single code file.
